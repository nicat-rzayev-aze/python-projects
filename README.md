# 📊 IBM Data Science Python Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization skills using Python. 
It contains two scripts analyzing stock prices of Tesla and GameStop using real-world data.

## Tools & Libraries
1.Python
  1.1.requests (to fetch web data)
  1.2.BeautifulSoup (to parse HTML data)
  1.3.yfinance (to get historical stock data)
  1.4.pandas (for data cleaning and table creation)
  1.5.matplotlib.pyplot (for visualization)
  1.6.sqlite3 (for date)

## Project Structure
1. `tesla_stock.py` - fetches and visualizes Tesla stock prices over time.
2. `gamestop_stock.py` - fetches and visualizes GameStop stock prices over time.
3. `images/` - screenshots of visualizations

## How It Works
1. Requests & BeautifulSoup are used to scrape IBM-provided sample data from the website.
2. yfinance fetches historical stock prices.
3. pandas organizes the data into clean, structured tables.
4. matplotlib visualizes stock value trends over time.

## How to Run
Run the scripts `tesla_stock.py` and `gamestop_stock.py` in Python to reproduce analysis and visualizations. Make sure you have installed the necessary libraries.

# Conclusion

## This project showcases Python skills in:
1.Web scraping and API usage
2.Data cleaning and table management
3.Data visualization
4.Basic database handling
5.Completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate to strengthen Python and data analysis skills.
